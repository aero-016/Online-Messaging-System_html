00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,570
Light, dinner time!

58
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,620
I'll solve equations with my right hand...

59
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,710
and write names with my left.

60
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,920
I'll take a potato chip...

61
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,000
and eat it!

62
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,970
The witness to my alibi is L himself.

63
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,970
Encounter

64
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,270
Are you sure, Ryuk?

65
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,600
Yeah. Nobody's following you.

66
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,730
G-Give it to me quickly. My withdrawal symptoms...

67
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,740
You're not just saying that so I'll give you an apple, right?

68
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,370
Hey, hey!

69
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,740
I've flown around and checked a hundred-meter radius around you.

70
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,750
I'm sure.

71
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,830
But there was the news report about Interpol dispatching 1,500 investigators.

72
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,050
It's a bluff, of course. You said it yourself.

73
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,760
If it were real, they would sneak in and investigate secretly.

74
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,470
All right, Ryuk. I'll buy you an apple.

75
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,970
All right!

76
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,100
Thank you very much.

77
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,480
Light! Quickly, quickly.

78
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,930
You really are a slave driver.

79
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,700
You had me search for cameras

80
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,540
and made me give up eating apples in the house.

81
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,810
Be sure to eat the core as well.

82
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,550
In the end, I'll really write your name in my Death Note, and kill ya!

83
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,180
Is this any time to be laughing?

84
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,430
That's right. , There's just one thing left to top everything off.

85
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,020
Ryuzaki...

86
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,480
Yes?

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,980
About the purse-snatcher and embezzler's heart attacks two days ago...

88
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,360
That happened before my family had any knowledge of it.

89
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
Have they been cleared?

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,530
I suppose you're right.

91
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,490
Even though Kira can control the time of death,

92
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,420
I don't think that there's any way he could set up his victims without watching that broadcasâ€”

93
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,630
Your son has come home again.

94
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,140
So, you're gonna shut up and act like you're studying again, huh?

95
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,430
I already have an idea of where all the cameras are.

96
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,730
But...

97
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,270
I was only able to kill

98
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:12,269
Murao Tayoshi

99
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,019
a purse-snatcher and an embezzler.

100
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,560
Suspect: Murao Tayoshi

101
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,190
They've committed really minor crimes compared to those I've killed until now.

102
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,130
Are you going to watch TV?

103
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,210
I killed criminals whose names and faces were broadcast

104
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,410
when I didn't have access to TV or the Internet.

105
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,830
But there still is a chance that I'll be suspected

106
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,670
because only minor criminals die when I don't have any information.

107
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,420
In other words,

108
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,010
if I also kill minor criminals being broadcast when I watch TV,

109
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,080
I won't call attention to myself.

110
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,260
Also, when I go out,

111
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,410
regardless of the severity of the crime,

112
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,560
I should remember the names of criminals broadcast.

113
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,560
I'll kill them at random times

114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,820
with the piece of the Death Note I left in my wallet.

115
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,550
Now my measures against the cameras are perfect.

116
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,660
During these past few days,

117
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,870
I have checked our tapes and video footage many times.

118
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,960
I've come to a decision.

119
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,270
Among the Kitamura and Yagami households...

120
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,010
no one is suspicious.

121
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,220
I shall remove the cameras and wiretaps.

122
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,940
So, in the end the culprit wasn't here, huh?

123
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,060
Don't lower your guard! We're going to narrow down our possibilities once more.

124
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,520
Please don't get the wrong idea.

125
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,530
I just meant that there wasn't anyone suspicious from what I could see from our footage.

126
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,660
Huh?

127
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,870
Even if Kira is among them, he wouldn't give himself away.

128
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,080
No,

129
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,370
it means that he was killing criminals as usual, without showing it.

130
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,590
Then you believe that one of them might be Kira?

131
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,010
I'd say it's...

132
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,630
a five-percent chance.

133
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,020
Kira was still killing people

134
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,810
even while the surveillance cameras were in place.

135
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,320
I don't know how he did it,

136
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,190
but even if he is able to kill people by wishing death upon them...

137
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,540
If he were a normal person, he would have behaved differently

138
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,260
or at least changed his facial expression when committing the murders.

139
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,160
Kira is not among them.

140
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,500
Most people would conclude that.

141
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,290
But... if Kira is one of them,

142
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,210
his psyche has reached a god-like level.

143
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,200
Judging sinners without changing his expression.

144
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,680
I want to believe that Kira doesn't really exist...

145
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,060
that this really is divine judgment.

146
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,230
But it's absurd to think that God would need

147
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,100
a person's face and name to kill.

148
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,830
But this isn't divine judgment by God.

149
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,520
It's the actions of someone childish who thinks he's God.

150
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,410
That's what this is.

151
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,910
The mass murderer known as Kira does exist.

152
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,830
And I will catch him.

153
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,550
But...

154
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,690
I don't think that Kira will expose himself

155
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,380
even if I keep these cameras in place.

156
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,550
What should I do?

157
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,990
It would be best to get him to tell me himself that he's Kira, and have him show me how he kills.

158
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,140
But there's no way I can...

159
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,690
Hey, Light, the cameras really have been removed!

160
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,770
Every single one of them!

161
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,650
Light, are you listening?

162
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,080
Hey, Light.

163
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,330
Oh, I see. The wiretaps might still be here.

164
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,960
I'm no longer a suspect.

165
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,800
It's all happened as I'd planned.

166
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,080
But L will probably continue to chase Kira.

167
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,770
And if he's still using the Japanese police,

168
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,640
my father will be among those being used.

169
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,690
If that's the case...

170
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,070
I'll use my father to find out L's identity so I can eliminate him.

171
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,580
If I just get rid of L,

172
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,030
Kira will be one step closer to becoming the god of the new world.

173
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,660
Light, hurry up.

174
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,080
Do your best!

175
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,330
Good luck, Light!

176
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,590
Really, you're making such a big fuss over this.

177
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,670
I'll be going.

178
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,100
It sure feels good, now that we know there aren't any wiretaps.

179
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,390
Well, it's nice to know that one cause of stress is gone before my test.

180
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,389
2007 Test Center for University Admissions

181
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,600
Once I start college,

182
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,520
I'll have more time to operate as Kira and search for L.

183
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,550
You there! The test will start in ten minutes! Hurry up!

184
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,530
I had planned to go in three minutes early because I didn't want to wait in the classroom.

185
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,200
I sure got here early.

186
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,120
That's some confidence you've got.

187
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,250
You may begin.

188
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,570
You there, number 162.

189
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,570
Sit in your seat properly!

190
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,700
There have been quite a lot of Shinigami looking real hard into the Human World lately.

191
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,320
What's with that?

192
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,660
It seems that Ryuk has turned into some human's pet.

193
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,710
Wh-What in the world is he thinking?

194
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,280
Really. He's a disgrace to all Shinigami.

195
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,720
No, I'm talking about the human who's keeping him.

196
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,190
Ryuk's probably not a very cute pet.

197
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,110
Well, yeah.

198
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,730
So what kind of human's keeping him? Is it a woman? A man?

199
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,280
Who knows?

200
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,850
I'll go take a peek as well.

201
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,070
Oh well...

202
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,300
2007 To-Oh University Entrance Ceremony

203
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,040
So you're a college student now, huh, Light?

204
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,310
My heart's filled with emotion.

205
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,530
Now for our freshman address.

206
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,780
And our freshman representative, Yagami Light.

207
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,510
Yes.

208
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,870
Oh, wow.

209
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,320
Likewise, freshman representative, Ryuga Hideki.

210
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,960
Oh! Got it...

211
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,320
Ryuga Hideki, the pop idol?!

212
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,710
Couldn't be... There's no way he's smart enough to enter To-Oh.

213
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,890
Ah... You're right. He doesn't even look anything like him.

214
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,180
I heard I was going to be giving the address with someone else,

215
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,560
but he's the last person I expected.

216
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,230
He's the guy who was sitting weird behind me

217
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,250
on the first day of the Exams.

218
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,900
He completely stood out from everyone else.

219
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,670
Life springs renewed in the breath of spring...

220
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,700
The person who scored highest on the test is supposed to do this, right?

221
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,310
This just means that there were two top scorers this year.

222
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,750
I heard they both had flawless scores in all subjects.

223
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,310
Seriously? I guess there really are people like that.

224
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,140
I definitely like the guy on the right!

225
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,300
What?! Kyoko, you're weird. Most people would choose the one on the left.

226
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,900
But those two sure are different.

227
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,520
Yeah.

228
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,030
One looks like a brilliant genius from a sheltered family.

229
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,980
The other...

230
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,330
Life springs renewed in the breath of spring...

231
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,950
...seems wild or at least very weird.

232
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,790
Is that what people would call a genius?

233
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,510
He is giving the address for the To-Oh entrance ceremony while he's dressed like that.

234
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,600
He is either not taking this seriously, or an idiot.

235
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,660
Thank you very much. Ryuga Hideki.

236
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,720
Yagami...

237
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,630
You're the son of Yagami Soichiro, Detective Superintendent of the NPA.

238
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,530
You have a sense of justice which rivals that of your respect for your father.

239
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,740
Who is this guy?

240
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,990
You also aim to become a police official

241
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,700
and have helped the police to solve several cases in the past.

242
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,000
You're now showing great interest in the Kira case.

243
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,160
I have faith in your sense of justice and abilities,

244
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,980
and if you swear not to tell anyone,

245
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,760
I'll tell you something very important concerning the Kira case.

246
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,260
What is this, all of a sudden?

247
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,470
Should I just ignore him?

248
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,720
But what is this important information concerning the Kira case?

249
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,600
I won't tell anyone. What is it?

250
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,640
I'm L.

251
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,460
It...

252
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,800
It couldn't be!

253
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,200
What is he talking about?!

254
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,300
There's no way that L would say that he's L.

255
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,540
I thought he was a strange guy, but is he really that weird?

256
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,990
Th-This isn't good.

257
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,590
Don't be shocked.

258
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,160
If he really is L...

259
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,810
I have to act naturally, how Yagami Soichiro's son, Light, would act.

260
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,640
If you truly are who you say you are, I respect and admire you.

261
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,980
Thank you.

262
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,240
I revealed myself because I think that you can be of help in solving the Kira case.

263
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,480
Yagami Light...

264
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,440
The probability that you are Kira is just under five percent.

265
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,550
But out of everyone we were watching, I sensed something from you.

266
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,450
You're inconceivably perfect.

267
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,050
And if you are Kira, there's nothing that could pressure you more than this.

268
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,120
If this guy really is L,

269
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,840
he's something else.

270
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,550
Indeed... if he really is L.

271
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,930
No, even if he isn't L...

272
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,600
I...

273
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,940
I can't do anything to him!

274
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,650
If what he's saying is true,

275
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,360
then he's probably already shown his face to my father.

276
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,720
If he dies as soon as he reveals his identity to me,

277
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,160
then suspicion will immediately fall onto me.

278
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,670
And he's using an obvious alias such as Ryuga Hideki.

279
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,430
If his name really isn't Ryuga Hideki

280
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,130
and I try to kill him by writing his name in the Death Note,

281
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:32,709
{\an8}Ryuga Hideki

282
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,280
the pop idol Ryuga's face will pop up in my head whether I want it to or not,

283
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,140
and he may die instead.

284
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,980
But he won't die and will surmise that I'm Kira.

285
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,430
Is he really L?

286
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,980
Also, does he suspect that I'm Kira?

287
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,060
I don't know how much he knows, but I'm sure he suspects me.

288
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,070
There's no other reason for him to tell Yagami Soichiro's son that he's L.

289
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,040
Does this mean that he's still focusing on the people

290
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,330
whom Raye Penber was investigating?

291
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,510
But why has L approached me directly?

292
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,670
Not now...

293
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,050
It's better to keep my mind blank.

294
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,970
I have to keep a straight face.

295
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,510
He's definitely checking to see whether I'm shocked now.

296
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,190
2007 To-Oh University Entrance Ceremony

297
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,820
That was an interesting college entrance ceremony, Light.

298
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,030
Yagami.

299
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,950
Hey, Light, he's calling you.

300
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,910
It was nice meeting you.

301
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,930
No, the pleasure was all mine.

302
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,660
What an amazing car.

303
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,590
A limousine?

304
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,260
Well, I'll see you around campus.

305
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,950
Oh, yeah.

306
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,880
Where's that rich kid from?

307
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,670
And he's even at the top of the class? What a jerk.

308
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,540
Ah, welcome home, To-Oh University student!

309
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,430
Damn! He got me!

310
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,100
He got you?

311
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,440
Damn you, L! I've never been so humiliated in my life!

312
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:55,320
Say, why don't you just do the Shinigami eye deal with me and kill him?

313
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,700
What good would that do if this is a trap?!

314
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,830
If he's not really L, then I might as well have I'm Kira written on my face!

315
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,830
S-Sorry...

316
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,250
There's a world of difference between Shinigami killing people and humans killing people.

317
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,510
I want to kill him no matter what it takes, but if I do, it'll be traced back to me.

318
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,930
The Death Note can only kill a person whose name I write in it.

319
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,810
I cannot control someone to kill someone else.

320
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,480
The Death Note is a pain in the ass!

321
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,520
Light is usually calm, but he's fuming now.

322
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,480
He's pretty irritated.

323
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,640
At first, I thought that when I found out his name,

324
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,650
I'd have him get in an accident or commit suicide.

325
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,990
But it's no good unless I know a hundred percent that he's L.

326
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,020
No. Even if I do know it's him,

327
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,490
it may be too late.

328
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,210
No matter what the cause of death, if L dies, I'll be suspected.

329
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,880
I underestimated him.

330
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:05,100
Never in a thousand years would I have thought that L would come up to me and say, I'm L.

331
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,390
He just has to tell all the suspects that he is L.

332
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,400
Even if he's his double,

333
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:19,190
this is a solid defense as well as an attack against Kira.

334
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,200
He beat me. It was a good move.

335
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,830
Ryuga will play dumb

336
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,540
and probably continue to approach me and manipulate me at the university.

337
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,220
This is great.

338
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,070
There's nothing to worry about.

339
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,580
This proves that they don't have anything on me.

340
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,100
It's a contest between L and me.

341
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,230
It's a game of wits!

342
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,280
On the surface, we'll be friendly acquaintances on campus.

343
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,280
In reality, we'll be investigating each other. Are you L? or Are you Kira?

344
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,300
This is interesting, Ryuga.

345
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,700
If it's friendship you want from me,

346
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,350
you can have it in spades.

347
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,830
I'll make you trust me,

348
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:19,120
and once I've pulled everything out of you, I will kill you...

349
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,300
with my own hands!

To be continued

351
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:26,379
I had a dream that no one could see

352
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,640
{\an8}â™ª dare ni mo mirenai yume o mite â™ª

353
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:31,639
I threw away everything that I didn't need

354
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,060
{\an8}â™ª iranai mono wa subete suteta â™ª

355
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,059
I'm holding these feelings that I can't give up in my heart

356
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,860
{\an8}â™ª yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite â™ª

357
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:41,859
I'm holding these feelings that I can't give up in my heart

358
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,740
{\an8}â™ª yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite â™ª

359
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:45,949
Even if my feet fall victim to the shackles of sacrifice

360
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:52,120
{\an8}â™ª mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite â™ª

361
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:52,329
In between reality and my ideal

362
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,170
{\an8}â™ª gisei no kase ni ashi o toraretemo â™ª

363
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:57,499
I can't hold back the flooding impulses

364
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,170
{\an8}â™ª afurereru shoudou osaekirenai â™ª

365
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,629
Because I have a strong desire to accomplish

366
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:09,850
{\an8}â™ª tsuyoku motomeru kokoro ga aru kara â™ª

367
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:10,429
'Deceit', 'fear', 'vanity', 'melancholy'

368
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:15,350
{\an8}â™ª 'itsuwari', 'osore', 'kyoshoku', 'urei' â™ª

369
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,349
I'm not weak enough

370
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:20,810
{\an8}â™ª samazama na negative ni â™ª

371
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:20,809
To believe any of these negative perceptions

372
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:26,150
{\an8}â™ª torawareru hodo yowaku wa nai â™ª

373
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,319
I'm a trickster who doesn't know solitude

374
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,700
{\an8}â™ª kodoku mo shiranu Trickster â™ª

375
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:30,699
I'm a trickster who doesn't know solitude

379
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,829
There's no way that he could profile me with this tennis game.
